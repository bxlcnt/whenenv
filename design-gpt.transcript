Let's create a latex package as a layer on top of etoolbox called whenenv. The
package has 3 commands. 1) whenEnv 2) whenEnable 3) whenDisable. All three of
them receive one argument whenName. whenEnv is idempotent. whenEnv does a NewEnv
and creates whenName and defaults to disable. subsequent whenEnv calls do
nothing. whenEnv has an internal control variable which is set to togglefalse.
whenEnable, first verifies that a previous whenEnv with same whenName was
created. If not issues an error. It then sets the control variable with
toggletrue. whenDisable is similar to whenEnable but it does a toggletrue. Is
this clear? do you have any questions?

Yes, that's clear! You're aiming to create a
LaTeX package whenenv layered on top of etoolbox, which introduces conditional
environments using toggles. Here's a quick recap to confirm understanding:

\whenEnv{foo} defines a new conditional environment whenfoo (idempotently) and
internally creates a toggle whenfoo@toggle, initialized to false.

\whenEnable{foo} sets whenfoo@toggle to true and ensures \whenEnv{foo} was
previously called (errors otherwise).

\whenDisable{foo} sets whenfoo@toggle to false, with the same check as above.

Usage of the whenfoo environment is conditional: content inside it is only rendered when the toggle is true.

All good! Would you like me to now write the .sty file for whenenv?


You said:

whenEnv should do a \NewEnviron{foo} at some point. Later in the doc
we will be using begin{foo}. That was also clear. Right?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, absolutely—that's a key point, and it's clear.

To reiterate and confirm:

\whenEnv{foo} must define a new environment foo (e.g. via \NewEnviron{foo} from
the environ package), where the body of foo will be conditionally typeset only
if the toggle whenfoo@toggle is true.

This means \begin{foo}...\end{foo} becomes valid LaTeX syntax after \whenEnv{foo} is invoked.

So the \NewEnviron is necessary for creating the user-facing \begin{foo} ... \end{foo} interface.

Ready for implementation when you are—shall I write the whenenv.sty file now?


You said:
yes.
